# Big Idea 2 Reflection: Data
Data is a powerful tool that helps us understand the world and make decisions. In this course, I learned that data comes in many forms, like numbers, text, images, and sound, and that the way it’s collected and represented can affect conclusions. I also realized that data can be biased and that privacy is important when handling it. Reflecting on Big Idea 2, I’ve become more critical of the information I encounter and more aware of the responsibility involved in using data.

# Big Idea 3 Reflection: Algorithms and Programming
Big Idea 3 taught me how algorithms and programming solve problems efficiently. I learned to break problems into smaller steps, write precise instructions, and use functions to manage complexity. I also understood that algorithms are not only about being correct but also about being efficient. This idea showed me that programming combines logical thinking with creativity, helping me solve problems both in coding and in real life.
