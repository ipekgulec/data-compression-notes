# Initials I & g

A SwiftUI project that draws my initials (I and g) in a 10×10 grid. Each circle is colored based on its position to form the letters. No arrays are used; only conditionals and simple logic.

**Target Audience:** People learning SwiftUI and beginner coders  
**Why?:** To practice grid layout, conditional coloring, and logic without arrays.  
**Design Choices:** Letters are formed using `if` statements; circles are dynamically colored to make the initials recognizable.  
**Hardest Part:** Figuring out the logic to draw the letter “g” properly using only `if` and `let`.  
**Learned:** Mapping rows and columns to shapes, using `ForEach` loops for grids, and SwiftUI circle coloring.
