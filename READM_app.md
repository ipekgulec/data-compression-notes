 # HydraCare – Water Intake Tracking App 

# Overview:
HydraCare is a simple one-screen app concept designed to help users keep track of their daily water intake. The idea behind the app is to support a healthy daily habit in a clear and practical way, without adding unnecessary complexity.
The interface is inspired by SwiftUI and focuses on being easy to read, quick to use, and suitable for everyday life.

# Design Idea:
Instead of trying to track many health metrics at once, HydraCare focuses on just one thing: hydration.
By keeping the app focused on a single goal, the user can understand their progress at a glance.

# The screen includes:
A clear title and short description
A circular progress indicator showing how much water has been consumed during the day
A simple action button to add a glass of water
A small disclaimer to clarify that the app does not provide medical advice

# Design Process:
I created this design using an iPhone frame in Figma to reflect a realistic mobile experience.
I started by placing the title and subtitle at the top to clearly communicate the app’s purpose.
Next, I designed a large circular progress indicator and placed it at the center of the screen, since it represents the most important information. Below it, I added a rounded button that allows users to quickly update their water intake.
Finally, I included a short disclaimer at the bottom of the screen to keep the app medically responsible. Throughout the process, I aimed to keep the layout simple and clean, following Apple’s design approach.

# Reflection:
This project was inspired by the idea that meaningful apps can start with a single screen and a single focus. Designing HydraCare helped me understand how simplicity and clarity can make a health-related app feel more approachable and useful in daily life.
