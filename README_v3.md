# What is Data Compression?
 
Data compression means making files smaller so they take up less space and are faster to send or download.
There are two types:
Lossless compression = No data is lost. You can get back the exact original file.
Lossy compression = Some small parts are removed (you can’t get back the exact original), but the file becomes much smaller. Usually used for photos, videos, and music.

Why do we compress data?
To save space on your device.
To upload/download files faster online.
To share files more easily with others (smaller file = easier to send).
To help apps or websites load faster (compressed images, videos).

How is different data compressed?
 A. Text (like .txt, .docx, .pdf)
Uses lossless compression.
Looks for repeated words or letters.
Makes patterns shorter (e.g. "aaaaaa" → "6a").
Common compressed formats:
.zip
.pdf
.docx (it's a zip file inside!)

Images / Photos
Can be lossless or lossy.
Tries to remove small details or colors you can’t see well.
Formats:
Lossless: PNG, GIF
Lossy: JPEG, WebP, HEIC

Music / Audio
Usually lossy, because small sounds can be removed.
Your ears often can’t hear tiny differences.
Popular formats:
MP3
AAC
OGG
FLAC (lossless)

Videos
Mix of images + audio + motion.
Almost always lossy.
Uses frame prediction (saves only the changes between frames).

# Collaboration:
Collaboration helps improve computing innovations by bringing together people with different backgrounds. Team members can share ideas, solve problems, and give helpful feedback. Working with others makes the final product more creative, fair, and useful. Talking to users and listening to different opinions also helps create more useful technology.
# Program Function and Purpose:
Programs are used for specific tasks. Input affects how the code works, and output shows the re:sult. Programs respond to events coming from users and other programs. Developers can improve their programs based on user feedback.

# Program Design
and Development:
Developers create programs using a step-by-step process focused on users. This process includes researching, designing, prototyping, and testing. Programs are improved by repeating these steps based on feedback. Breaking problems into smaller parts helps ensure each part works well before adding it to the whole program. Developers create programs that can be improved by users' comments.

# Identifying and Correcting Errors:
Programs can have mistakes like logic, syntax, or run-time errors. Developers find these errors by testing and debugging. They use different inputs to see if the program works well. Fixing errors helps make the program better and easier to use.
